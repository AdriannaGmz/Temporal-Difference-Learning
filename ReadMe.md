# Temporal-Difference Learning Demos in Matlab

In this package you will find Matlab codes which demonstrate some selected
examples of *temporal-difference learning* methods in *prediction problems* and in *reinforcement learning*.

To begin:

* Run `DemoGUI.m`
* Start with the set of predefined demos: select one and press *Go*
* Modify demos: select one of the predefined demos, and modify the options

Feel free to distribute and use the package especially for educational purposes. I learned too much from the image of cliff-walking ;)
It is hosted on github: https://github.com/sinairv/TemporalDifferenceLearning

## Why temporal difference learning is important

A quotation from *R. S. Sutton*, and *A. G. Barto* from their book *Introduction to Reinforcement Learning* ([here](http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~sutton/book/ebook/node60.html))

> If one had to identify one idea as central and novel to reinforcement learning, it would undoubtedly be temporal-difference (TD) learning. 

Many basic reinforcement learning algorithms such as *Q-Laerning* and *SARSA* are in essence a *temporal difference learning method*.
